## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems relating to computers. Generally speaking this only involves the software aspect of computers. This could be anywhere from the code that runs an operating system, 
all the way up to writing hello world in python. This work is so important because the entire world runs on software, everywhere we look there's something running on a software system. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist
I approach problems similar to how I approach any problem. I debug, troubleshoot, iterate, and eventually I find the solution.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I think the ethical issues really come down to what kind of system is being worked on. If, for example I specialize in software that operates a moving vehicle, or a piece of it, then the ethical
issues here have human lives at stake.
